  <p style="font-family: "Georgia";"><b>Figure 1</b> is a heat-map raster visualization, depicting the density (summed count) of Bigfoot sightings for each month in the years 1970-2021. The yellow-to-red color scheme indicates a greater count at a specific value on the grid. The raster is interactive with ToolTip, so hovering over the rectangle values displays the number of sightings for that particular month, as well as the number of distinct sighting classifications (A, B, or C).</p>
  <p style="font-family: "Georgia";"><b>Figure 2</b> is a choropleth map of the United States of America, which displays various points corresponding to the locations of each recorded Bigfoot sighting. The color of each state in the choropleth map corresponds to the state's forest coverage, most recently depicting the year 2016, expressed as a percent. Thus, darker greens correspond to states with higher forest coverage. The points on the map, as stated before, correspond to each instance of a recorded sighting. The colors distinguish which season that sighting occured (Winter is November - February, Spring is March - May, Summer is June - August, and Autumn is September - October). 
  This map is interactive using ToolTip as well. Hovering over each point shows additional information, such as the BFRO's numerical sighting descriptor, BFRO report details, the sighting classification, and the date. Each season in the legend may be clicked in order to isolate the points corresponding to that season.</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="font-family: "Georgia";"><small>The data that constitutes the Bigfoot sighting data (and all corresponding information) chiefly comes from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization's (BFRO) Bigfoot sighting database, found on their official website: <i>http://www.bfro.net/GDB/default.asp</i>. This data has been converted into a csv file by Tim Renner on data.world, which can be found here: <i>https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data</i>.
